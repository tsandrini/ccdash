# ccdash

A live dashboard for all your running Claude Code sessions: which ones are
working, which are waiting on you, and which look stuck. On the desktop as a
[DankMaterialShell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell) plugin,
on the phone as a web page.

> **Status:** early work in progress. Nothing below works yet.

## How it works

```text
Claude Code hooks ──► ccdash emit ─┐
statusline ─────────► ccdash tee ──┼──► ccdash daemon ──┬──► web UI (LAN / VPN)
claude agents --json ──────────────┤    (per host)      └──► DMS plugin
niri window events ────────────────┘
```

- Every session reports through Claude Code hooks to a small daemon on the
  same machine. The daemon keeps live state in memory and history in SQLite.
- The **web UI** is read-only and meant for the phone. Tapping a session opens
  it in the Claude app through Remote Control.
- The **DMS plugin** adds a bar indicator, a quick list, and a full dashboard
  tab. Clicking a session focuses its terminal window in niri.

Only public Claude Code interfaces are used (`claude agents --json`, hooks,
the statusline payload); no internal state files.
